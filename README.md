## User Story
As a marketing agency
I Want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
So that our own site is optimized for search engines

## Project Outline

I took the existing code provided and updated it to meet accessibility standards.
I changed Non-Semantic HTML to Semantic HTML for better SEO and web accessibility
I gave a descritive title to the title element in the head. 
I fixed a broken link for Search Engine Optimization in the header.
I added alt attributes to all images, to meet web accessibility in the main and aside.
Any HTML element changes that were made in the HTML, I made sure to reflect those changes in the CSS Style Sheet.
CSS selectors and properties were consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
CSS file was properly commented.
