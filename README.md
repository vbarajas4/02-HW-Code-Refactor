## User Story
As a marketing agency
I Want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
So that our own site is optimized for search engines

## Project Outline

* I took the existing code provided and updated it to meet accessibility standards.
* I changed Non-Semantic HTML to Semantic HTML for better SEO and web accessibility
* I gave a descritive title to the title element in the head. 
* I fixed a broken link for Search Engine Optimization in the header.
* I added alt attributes to all images, to meet web accessibility in the main and aside.
* Any HTML element changes that were made in the HTML, I made sure to reflect those changes in the CSS Style Sheet.
* CSS selectors and properties were consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
* CSS file was properly commented.
